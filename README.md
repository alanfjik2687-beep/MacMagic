# MacMagic For Mac

MacMagic is a macOS utility that gives quick access to a variety of “hidden” or less-visible system tools and functions — things that regular macOS doesn’t expose easily. The latest version is 1.2.7 (as of March 26, 2025). It’s compatible with macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later, and works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
